## .gitignore
Before you commit any repos: copy this [`.gitgnore` file](https://github.com/cprg210/sample-code/blob/master/.gitignore) (or use your own) into your repository root and commit it. 

This will prevent problematic files from being added to your untracked files list (such as your `node_modules` directory or hidden files used only by your operating system).
